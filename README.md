This project was created to allow two users on the same computer to play BlackJack with each other.

There is an option to display the leaderboard of players who are elite at playing BlackJack on this particular website. 
The leaderboard can be updated by removing players as well as adding them to the list.

The website displays how many cards are left in the deck so it is easier to card count. I will also be adding a feature that shows the cards
that are in a particular players hand.

The website is intelligent enough to know which cards have already been delt so it does not deal the same card twice in a single set. 
After each set the cards are reshuffled and the game of BlackJack operates how it should, using randomness in each set.

The website displays the winner of each set and will eventually show how many wins a player has in the particular session.
